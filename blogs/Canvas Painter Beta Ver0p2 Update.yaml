      <h2>Canvas Painter Beta Ver0.2 Update</h2>
  - > 
      Over the past 2 weeks, I had focused on implementing the button functions of painter app. I would like the app to have a function for users to save data of the strokes, colors and load 
      them back to the app. I would also like to add a clear canvas button for user to clear the entire canvas easily and also an undo and redo function. The undo, redo and clear button is 
      implemented sucessfullly but I thought a lot on ways to save the data.

      Firstly, I simply save the file as json but later I think that this method is kind'a boring and not special. I then decided to save my data embeded inside an image so user can download 
      the data with the image and load the image again to the app to add or edit the drawing. After some research, I found out saving the string as byte array and append it on the end of the 
      image dataURl byte array is the simplest way of achieving data saving in an image. Thus, I implemented the image saving function with this method.

      After some days, I was testing with the image saving and loading function and I realised a problem in saved image with data. As a result, some of the image opening programs does not 
      recognise the image with data as the data is appended on the end of the image data. I then started searching other ways to do data saving in images on the Internet. After some searching, 
      I saw a youtube video by Computerphile about image Steganography. <br>
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWEXCYQKyDc">Secrets Hidden in Images (Steganography) - Computerphile</a> <br>
      The method is to put data on the lowest 2 bit of the bytes representing colors on the image. Thus, I updated the saving function using this method. However, image with the old method can 
      also be opened with some tweaks (adding a new line 'DATA' on the end of the image data).

      <h2>New project: Raylib C++</h2>
  - > 
      Recently, I has started a project about game engine and game development using Raylib library in c++. My aim is to create a some kind'a library to make 2d games and animations with Raylib. 
      The project is still in very early phase and I am currently learing and doing researching about it. I would like to create an ECS system to handle game objects, item, and game logic while 
      using the Raylib library to render the game objects in opengl. I will upload the project onto my github when I done researching and create a demo game using it.
