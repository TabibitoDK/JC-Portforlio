      According to wikipedia, YAML is a human-readable data-serialization language. It is commonly used for configuration files and 
      in applications where data is being stored or transmitted. YAML targets many of the same communications 
      applications as Extensible Markup Language (XML) but has a minimal syntax which intentionally differs 
      from SGML. It uses Python-style indentation to indicate nesting.

      The use of YAML ease the website editor to edit and add new content. Traditionally, adding content in the html 
      files is more complecated and time spending as html files included other data such as website layout and 
      html tags that are not neccesary to be changed when editing website's content and when adding new contents. 
      Thus, with the use of YAML as a language to store website content, html data such as tags are will not be 
      ultered when editing website content and website content can be added and edited easily and fast.
